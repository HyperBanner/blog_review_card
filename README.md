This is a Project for [FrontendMentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io).

# Thoughts
This was a pretty easy page to do. Just wanted to see how much CSS knowledge retained in my brain.
Shoutouts to FrontendMentor for this challenge. The entire design was done by them, I only coded the design into a page!

Done by regular ol' CSS Flexbox, no external libraries used.

You can checkout the page in the deployments.
